#+title:  Nix OS / Home Manager

- DE: Hyprland

You may have noted that i barely use the power of nix configs. There is two major reasons behind that, firstly
i am very new in the nix/os world. Secondly, i also **need** to be able to use my configurations outside of a
nix environment therefore i have to use a maximum amount of raw config files.

** Requirement

This is a **NixOS** configuration and i haven't tested it outside. Nix flakes and home-manager are required.
Since home-manager is OS agnostic, it may works outside of NixOS.

** flake.nix
After you cloned that repository anywere in your system, run the following commands to load the system and user
configurations.

#+begin_src sh
$> sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .

# switch home user
$> nix build .#homeManagerConfigurations.whale.activationPackage
$ >  result/active
#+end_src
